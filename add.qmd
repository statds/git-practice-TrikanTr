hello this is a few lines of text for the assignment
it will be interesting to try and manage the workload of this class
and curious to see the kinds of products expected for the presentations and projects
excitement
worried but confident
something was going wrong for a bit there my mind was confused on the syntax for git revert and reset. reset did not do what i thought it would and revert was confusing but eventually i figured it out thanks to some research so i can continue

so that's at least a good thing for today
